        A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual’s distinct personality traits. In
        most instances, your personality will influence relationships with your family, friends, and classmates
        and contribute to your health and well-being. Teachers can administer a personality test in class to help
        your children discover their strengths and developmental needs. The driving force behind
        administering a personality test is to open up lines of communication and bring students together to
        have a higher appreciation for one another. A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what
        teaching strategies will be the most effective for their students.

        One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test. This personality test asks
        a serious of questions to rate your likes and dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a
        blue, green, orange or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually a
        student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it
        allows teachers to understand the personality attributes associated with various students. You will
        operate as one primary color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental factors
        can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your
        strong attributes and keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.
        Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week of school. A personality
        test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and
        activities for their students.
