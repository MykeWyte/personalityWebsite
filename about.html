              Personality tests help people understand more about how they function.
              One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test. This personality test asks
              a serious of questions to rate your likes and dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a
              blue, green, orange or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually a
              student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it
              allows teachers to understand the personality attributes associated with various students. You will
              operate as one primary color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental factors
              can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your
              strong attributes and keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.
              Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week of school. A personality
              test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and
              activities for their students.
